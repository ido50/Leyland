# ABSTRACT: Leyland view base class

=head1 NAME

Leyland::View - Leyland view base class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# if you're planning on creating a new Leyland view class,
	# then do something like this:

	package Leyland::View::SomeEngine;

	use Moo;
	use namespace::clean;
	use SomeEngine;

	with 'Leyland::View';

	has 'engine' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { SomeEngine->new });

	sub render {
		my ($self, $view, $context, $use_layout) = @_;

		$use_layout = 1 unless defined $use_layout;

		return $self->engine->render($view, $context, $use_layout);
	}

	1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Moo role|Moo::Role> describes how Leyland view classes - mostly
used to render HTML responses (but can be used for pretty much anything) -
are to be built. A view class uses a template engine (such as L<Template::Toolkit> or
<Tenjin>) to render responses.

Leyland's default view class is L<Leyland::View::Tenjin>, which uses the
L<Tenjin> template engine.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

Consuming classes are required to implement the following methods:

=head2 render( $view_name, [ \%context, $use_layout ] )

This method receives the name of a view (or "template" if you will, such
as 'index.html' or 'resource.json'), and a hash-ref of variables to be
available for the template (known as the "context"). Leyland will automatically
include 'c' for the request's context object (most probably a L<Leyland::Context>
object) and 'l' for the application object. C<$use_layout>, if provided,
will be a boolean value indicating whether the view should be rendered
inside a layout view (not relevant for every template engine). Expected
to be true by default.

Returns the rendered output.
