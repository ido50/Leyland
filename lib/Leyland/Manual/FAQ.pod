Leyland::Manual::FAQ - Frequently asked questions about Leyland

=head1 HOW CAN I MAKE MY APP ANSWER "OPTIONS" REQUESTS?

The HTTP C<OPTIONS> request method is used by clients to ask a server what
are the HTTP methods they can perform on a certain resource (or URI path
if you will). The server is supposed to answer with the response header
"Allow", containing a list of valid methods, like "GET, POST, PUT".

The good news for you is that L<Leyland> already does this automatically for
you. When it receives an C<OPTIONS> request to a certain resource, it finds
out all methods supported by it, and returns a proper answer to the client.

=head1 HOW CAN I MAKE MY APP ANSWER "HEAD" REQUESTS?

The HTTP C<HEAD> request method is exactly similar to C<GET>, except only
the response headers are returned, without the response body. If you want
to add support for HEAD requests in your Leyland applications, add the
L<Head|Plack::Middleware::Head> Plack middleware to C<app.psgi>.

=head1 WHY ARE YOU NOT USING PLACK'S LOGGING MIDDLEWARES?

Since v1.0.0, Leyland does! Look at L<Leyland::Manual::Logging> for more info.

=head1 WHAT'S NEXT?

This is the last stop of the Leyland manual. You can L<return to the table of contents|Leyland::Manual/"TABLE OF CONTENTS">
if you wish or start writing your applications.
