Leyland - Plack-based framework for RESTful web applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# in app.psgi:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use MyApp;

	my $config = {
		app => 'MyApp',
		views => ['Tenjin'],
		locales => './i18n',
	};

	my $myapp = MyApp->new(config => $config);

	my $app = sub {
		$myapp->handle(shift);
	};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Leyland is a L<Plack>-based application framework for building truely
RESTful, MVC-style web applications.

"Another application framework?" you ask? Well yes! You see, after several
years of L<Catalyst> development, I grew tired of Catalyst's bloat, and
the fact that it made it very hard (pretty much impossible if you ask me)
to create truely RESTful applications. I then moved for a short while to
L<Dancer>, which had a nice syntax for defining routes and had at least some REST properties,
but I quickly found it didn't fit my needs as well, and that it also made
it very difficult to write truely RESTful applications. I also really missed
the whole "context object" and some of Catalyst's other features,
and simply couldn't get used to Dancer's whole
functional syntax you're supposed to use inside your routes. While there
were quite a few other options on CPAN, I didn't like any of them, plus
pretty much none of them were native Plack frameworks, which for me is
a bit of a minus (can't blame them though as most of them predate Plack),
so I decided to create my own framework, based on Plack and
designed to my liking. This is the mess that I've created. You will find
that it mostly resembles Catalyst, while providing a syntax mostly similar
to Dancer, but with a lot of crazy ideas of its own.

=head2 FEATURES

=over

=item * Build truely RESTful web applications - Leyland was designed from
the ground up according to the Representational State Transfer style of
software architecture. Leyland applications perform real HTTP negotiations,
(can) provide different representations of the same resource easily, respond
with proper HTTP status codes, throw real HTTP exceptions, etc.

=item * Automatic data (de)serialization - Leyland does by itself the boring task
of serializing resources to representations in the format your client
wants to receive, like JSON and XML. It will also deserialize JSON/XML
requests to Perl data-structures automatically.

=item * Pure UTF-8 - Leyland applications are pure UTF-8. Anything your
application receives is automatically UTF-8 decoded, and anything your
application sends is automatically UTF-8 encoded. Leyland apps will not
accept, nor provide, content in a different character set. If you want to
use different/multiple encodings, then Leyland is not for you.

=item * Localize for the client, not the server - Pretty much every other
application framework only concerns itself with localizing the application
to the locale of the machine on which it is running. I find that this is
rarely useful nor interesting to the application developer. Leyland localizes for
the client, not the server. If the client wants to view your application
(which may be a simple website) in Hebrew, and your application supports
Hebrew, then you can easily provide him with Hebrew representations.
Leyland uses L<Locale::Wolowitz> for this purpose.

=item * Easy deployment and middleware support via L<Plack> - Leyland doesn't
support Plack, it is dependant on it. Leyland's entire session support,
for example, depends on Plack's L<Session|Plack::Middleware::Session>
middleware. Use the full power of Plack in your Leyland application.

=item * Less code, better programs - One thing I really hated about Catalyst
was that I had to create stupid pointless classes that don't do anything
but wrap a base class, just so I can have a new view class or something.
While not as lightweight as Dancer, Leyland does a lot of the boring work
for you, so you can concentrate more on your application.

=item * Flexible, extensible, unbreakable - Well, it's not unbreakable,
but Leyland was designed to be as flexible and as extensible as possible - where
flexibility matters, and strict - where constistency and convention are appropriate.
Leyland goes to great lengths to give you the ability to do things the
way you want to, and more importantly - the way your end-users want to.
Your applications listen to your users' preferences and automatically decide on a
suitable course of action. Leyland is also L<Moose> based, making it easy
to extend and tweak its behavior.

=item * Doesn't have a pony - You don't really need a pony, do you?

=head2 STATUS

Development of Leyland began August 2010. I have been using it extensively
for several projects, some of them already in production. Therefore, the
API has somewhat stabilized and I do not consider it in alpha status.
That said, Leyland still is immature, and I cannot guarantee that API
changes won't be made, nor that it is bug free or even secure enough. If
you're thinking of using Leyland for a production project, please test it
thoroughly beforehand.

=head2 MANUAL / TUTORIAL / GUIDE / GIBBERISH

To learn about using Leyland, please refer to the L<Leyland::Manual>. The
documentation of this distribution's classes is for reference only, the
manual is where you're most likely to find your answers. Or not.

=head2 WHAT'S WITH THE NAME?

Leyland is named after Mr. Bean's clunker of a car - the British Leyland
Mini 1000. I don't know why.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 config

A hash-ref of configuration options for the application. If not provided,
a default configuration will be used.

=head2 context_class

The name of the class to be used as the context class for every request.
Defaults to L<Leyland::Context>. If provided, the class must extend
Leyland::Context.

=head2 name

The package name of the application, for example C<MyApp> or C<My::App>.
Automatically created from the app's configuration. If config doesn't
define a name, 'Leyland' will be used.

=head2 log

A logger object that C<does> L<Leyland::Logger>, providing the application
with logging capabilities. Automatically built from the app's config, unless
config doesn't define a logger, in which case L<Leyland::Logger::STDERR>
will be used.

=head2 localizer

If application config defines a path for localization files, this will hold
a L<Leyland::Localizer> object, which is based on L<Locale::Wolowitz>.

=head2 views

An array refernce of all L<Leyland::View> classes enabled in the app's
configuration. If none defined, L<Tenjin> is used by default.

=head2 routes

A L<Tie::IxHash> object holding all routes defined in the application's
controllers. Automatically created, not to be used directly by applications.

=head2 req_counter

An integer representing the number of requests handled by the application.
Automatically created.

=head2 cwe

The plack environment in which the application is running. This is the
C<PLACK_ENV> environment variable. Defaults to "development" unless you've
provided a specific value to C<plackup> (via the C<-E> switch or by
changing C<PLACK_ENV> directly).

=cut

has 'cwe' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', default => $ENV{PLACK_ENV});

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new( [ %attrs ] )

Creates a new instance of this class. None of the attributes are required
(in fact, you shouldn't pass most of them), but you will mostly pass
the C<config> attribute, and possibly the C<context_class> attribute.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 setup()

Meant to be overridden by applications, this is automatically called
right after the application has been initialized, so it is useful for
one-time initializations your application might need to perform. If not
overridden, this method does nothing.

=cut

sub setup { 1 }

=head2 handle( \%env )

Receives a Plack environment hash-ref of an HTTP request, creates a new
instance of the application's context class (most probably L<Leyland::Context>),
performs HTTP negotiations and finds routes matching the request. If any
are found, the first one is invoked and an HTTP response is generated and
returned.

You should note that requests to paths that end with a slash will automatically
be redirected without the trailing slash.

This method will probably be called from C<app.psgi>.

=cut

sub handle {
	my ($self, $env) = @_;

	# increment the request counter
	$self->_set_req_counter($self->req_counter + 1);

	# create the context object
	my $c = $self->context_class->new(
		app => $self,
		env => $env,
		num => $self->req_counter
	);

	# does the request path have an "unnecessary" trailing slash?
	# if so, remove it and redirect to the resulting URI
	if ($c->path ne '/' && $c->path =~ m!/$!) {
		my $newpath = $`;
		my $uri = $c->uri;
		$uri->path($newpath);
		
		$c->res->redirect($uri, 301);
		return $c->_respond;
	}

	# is this an OPTIONS request?
	if ($c->method eq 'OPTIONS') {
		# get all available methods by using Leyland::Negotiator
		# and return a 204 No Content response
		$c->log->info('Finding supported methods for requested path.');
		return $c->_respond(204, { 'Allow' => join(', ', Leyland::Negotiator->find_options($c, $self->routes)) });
	} else {
		# negotiate for routes and invoke the first matching route (if any).
		# handle route passes and return the final output after UTF-8 encoding.
		# if at any point an expception is raised, handle it.
		return try {
			# get routes
			$c->log->info('Searching matching routes.');
			$c->_set_routes(Leyland::Negotiator->negotiate($c, $self->routes));

			# invoke first route
			$c->log->info('Invoking first matching route.');
			my $ret = $c->_invoke_route;

			# are we passing to the next matching route?
			# to prevent infinite loops, limit passing to no more than 100 times
			while ($c->_pass_next && $c->current_route < 100) {
				# we need to pass to the next matching route.
				# first, let's erase the pass flag from the context
				# so we don't try to do this infinitely
				$c->_set_pass_next(0);
				# no let's invoke the route
				$ret = $c->_invoke_route;
			}

			$c->finalize(\$ret);
			
			$c->_respond(undef, undef, $ret);
		} catch {
			$self->_handle_exception($c, $_);
		};
	}
}

=head2 has_localizer()

Returns a true value if the application has a localizer.

=head2 has_views()

Returns a true value if the application has any view classes.

=head2 has_routes()

Returns a true value if the application has any routes defined in its
controllers.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

The following methods are only to be used internally.

	# create the object
	return $class->$orig(%opts);
};

=head2 BUILD()

Automatically called by L<Moose> after instance creation, this method
loads the context class, application logger, localizer, controllers and
views. It then find all routes in the controllers, runs the application's
setup() method, and prints a nice info table to the log.
