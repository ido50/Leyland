=head1 NAME

leyland - Leyland application generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# from the command line
	leyland app --author "Some Guy" --email "some_guy@email.com" MyApp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is used to easily create new L<Leyland> applications. Provided
with an application name, and possibly other optional information, this
script will create the application's structure on the file system, and
also all the base files needed for the application, so the new application
is immediately usable (but probably not useful) after running this script.

You really don't have to use this script to create applications though.
You can create the application's structure and base files by hand if you
wish. However, until you are familiar with Leyland application structure,
it is a good idea to use this script to start your applications.

In the future, this script will also perform other operations, such as
creating new controllers in existing applications.

=head1 USAGE

Using this script is very simple. From the command line, invoke this
script with the name of the operation you wish to perform (currently,
only "app", for creating a new application, is supported), followed by
a list of zero or more options, and finally zero or more arguments.

The "app" command takes the following options:

=over

=item * -a | --author - The name of the application's author.

=item * -e | --email - The email address of the application's author.

=back

It also takes one argument - the application's name. This should be the
application's package name, such as C<My::App>, not L<My-App>.
